# C# Education Camp

This repository includes a collection of projects developed during the C# Education Camp. Each project is designed to teach specific programming concepts, with examples and hands-on practice. Below is an overview of each project.

---

## Project 1: Main Subjects

### Description:
This project covers the fundamental topics of C# programming, providing an introduction to the language's basic syntax and structure. The main subjects include:
- Writing first C# program
- Understanding program structure
- Key language components

### Key Concepts:
- C# syntax
- Basic input/output
- Comments and conventions

---

## Project 2: Variables

### Description:
This project introduces the concept of variables in C#. It explains how to declare, initialize, and use variables to store and manipulate data. Topics covered include:
- Variable types and their usage
- Scope and lifetime of variables
- #Region usage

### Key Concepts:
- Primitive types (int, double, char, string, etc.)
- Data type conversion

---

## Project 3: Decision Structures

### Description:
This project explores decision-making structures in C#, such as `if` statements and `switch-case` constructs. Also it is implemented how to control the flow of program based on logical conditions.
- Decision structures overview
- Conditional logic and expressions
- Practical examples using control flow

### Key Concepts:
- If usage
- Switch-case usage
- Logical operators

---

## Project 4: Loops

### Description:
This project focuses on loops in C#. Learn how to perform repetitive tasks efficiently using different types of loops, such as `for` and `while` loops. The project includes:
- Looping constructs and their use cases
- Controlling loop execution
- Common pitfalls in looping logic (aviod infinite loop while using "while" loop)

### Key Concepts:
- For loop
- While loop
- For usage with conditional statements

---

## Project 5: Loops with Stars

### Description:
A creative project where loops are used to generate patterns with stars (`*`). It is implemented how to manipulate loop structures to display different shapes, such as triangles, pyramids, and diamonds.
- Nested loops for pattern generation
- Console output formatting
- Practical use of loops in solving visual problems

### Key Concepts:
- Pattern creation with loops
- Console output control
- Nested loop logic

---

## Project 6: Arrays

### Description:
Arrays are a key part of managing collections of data in C#. This project covers how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays in a variety of ways.
- One-dimensional arrays
- Basic operations such as sorting and searching

### Key Concepts:
- Array declaration and initialization
- Traversing arrays
- Arrays usage with loops and conditional statements
- Arrays methods

---

## Project 7: Foreach Loop

### Description:
This project focuses on the `foreach` loop, a powerful structure for iterating over collections such as arrays and lists. It simplifies collection traversal and is used frequently in C# applications.
- How `foreach` works and its advantages over other loops
- Iterating over collections safely and efficiently

### Key Concepts:
- `foreach` loop syntax
- Collection traversal
- Foreach usage with conditional statements
- Foreach with Lists

---

## Project 8: Methods

### Description:
Methods are crucial for writing reusable and modular code. This project teaches how to define and use methods, pass parameters, and return values.
- Void methods --> with parameters & non parameters
- Return Value Methods --> with parameters & non parameters

### Key Concepts:
- Method declaration
- Return types
- Method Calls
- Methods with conditional statements

---

## Project 9: Database Project

### Description:
This project integrates C# with a database system, demonstrating how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Connecting a C# application to a database using ADO.NET and execute SQL queries.
- Setting up database connections
- CRUD operations with SQL
- Database interaction from C# applications

### Key Concepts:
- ADO.NET
- SQL queries in C#
- Database connectivity and management
